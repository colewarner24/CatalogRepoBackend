# CatalogRepoBackend

Developed with NODE js, Express, MongoDB, and calls to the SpotifyAPI

100% test coverage within the Models folder if you do not include the API calls and database connection. Unable to build consistent tests with calls to the Spotify API.

## Getting Started

If you want to be able to replicate this project, then the instructions below should help.

Front-end: https://github.com/catalogTeam/CatalogRepoFE

Back-end: https://github.com/colewarner24/CatalogRepoBackend

To run this locally, all you need to do is download both repositories and run them individually.

Locally, the Front-end runs on port 3000, and the Back-end runs on port 5000.

Front-end command script

```md
npm start
```

Back-end command script

```md
npm run dev
```

## Setting Up Backend Environmental Variables

Environmental Variables used:

```md
MONGODB_URI= (A mongoDB URL for a connection ot the Database)

CLIENT_ID= A User spotify Client ID to connect to the spotify API

CLIENT_SECRET= A User spotify Client Secret to connect to the spotify API

TOKEN_SECRET = (A Token secret for the authentication of a password system. Could just be a randomly hashed number)
```

## Setting Up Heroku Backend Environmental Variables

Due to the backend requiring environmental variables, that also means for deployment of the backend, Config Vars are required for heroku.

```md
CLIENT_ID= A User spotify Client ID to connect to the spotify API

CLIENT_SECRET= A User spotify Client Secret to connect to the spotify API

MONGODB_URI= (A mongoDB URL for a connection ot the Database)

TOKEN_SECRET = (A Token secret for the authentication of a password system. Could just be a randomly hashed number)

***HEROKU_ENV_VAR = true***
```

## Installing Packages Used

Use command

We used a ton of packages, so best way to install it is to just use the command

```md
npm install
```

On the terminal

## Continuous Integration / Deployment

We used heroku for our CI from this github repository. Connecting our CI requires editing our YML file and runnning the code below.

```md
npx prettier --write .
```

The CI requires prettier to be checked and ran before the continuing of our CI.

In the -> Github\workflow\node.js.yml

Edit the snippet below with your own heroku_app_name and heroku_email. (This is done by signing up on their website and obtaining the information after deploying a project)

```
with:
    heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}
    heroku_app_name: "heroku_app_name" #Must be unique on Heroku
    heroku_email: "heroku_email" #Must be the one you used on Heroku
```
